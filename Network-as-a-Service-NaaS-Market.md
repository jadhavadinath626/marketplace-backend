Additionally, the need for better network management and automation is encouraging companies to move away from traditional network models and explore more agile, cost-effective alternatives such as NaaS. By 2027, the NaaS market is expected to surpass USD 75 billion, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 25%. Regions like North America and Europe are anticipated to hold the largest market share, due to the rapid adoption of cloud technologies and the high concentration of IT infrastructure.
